Here's an opinion. You might agree or disagree, and I'll admit it's just a bit over-simplified and over-stated. But it's my opinion...

The most important and exciting "new" thing to happen in the Catholic Church in the last couple decades is the liturgical movement I would like to call "the Benedictine Reform." It is more often referred to as "the Reform of the Reform," but I think that is not the best descriptor (for reasons I will, perhaps, go into in another post).

Here's another opinion, even more over-stated-
In the United States, the most important single contributor to the musical aspects of the Benedictine Reform is Jeff Ostrowski.

Ok. I'm sure he would disagree with me, and there are certainly other individuals highly qualified for such a ridiculously over-the-top statement.

But here's my thinking on this:
Most of the other (very excellent) musical contributors are (for the most part, I would say) "preaching to the choir." There are some amazing composers writing amazing work... which will only be performed by choirs already singing amazing music. There are people adapting Gregorian chant to English, people teaching others how to chant, people promoting a true and beautiful approach to the sacre liturgy. There is amazing work being done on all levels. But the movement remains something a of a minority, a "special interest group" within the Church: some people support the Knights of Columbus, some people donate to their local parochial school, some people care about liturgy.

That is to be expected- it will always be that way, I think. But, even with the fact that only a (relative) handful ever care about liturgy and music, we still managed to have quite a revolution in liturgical practice over the last 40 years, didn't we? And it can happen again (for the better!), thanks to the work of Jeff Ostrowski and people like him.

Here's what I mean. As has been <a href="http://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2009/09/fire-is-out.html#.UjG219IySuk" target="_blank">discussed</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1569290830/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1569290830&linkCode=as2&tag=musforsun-20" target="_blank">documented</a>, the revolution in music and liturgy was neither a grass-roots movement, nor a mandate from on high, nor the invention of a single commercial interest. Rather, it was a combination of all these forces which brought about the wholesale cultural change. There was grass roots movement of people writing and singing a different kind of song, sharing them at workshops and retreats. There was a perceived mandate (real or imagined, it doesn't matter) for a renewal of the liturgy. There were individual Bishops here and there who wanted something new. And then all that potential for change catalysed when <a href="http://www.ocp.org/NALR" target="_blank" title="NALR">someone</a> figured out how to commercialize it.

And even though most people "back then" didn't care or know much about music and liturgy, and most people today don't care (or know much about it), they are still steeped in the musical culture that was created.

Today, we have a similar nexus of influence.

A grass-roots movement has been steadily growing- people learning to chant, learning about the traditional music of the Church, and the real content of the liturgy. The grass-roots movement is sustained and grown through workshops and retreats and freely copied music. People steal form each other, copy from each other, share with each other. People laugh at the stodgy old folks, people travel across the country to get inspired by a new song.

There has been a (real, BTW) mandate from "on high," in Pope Benedict's frequent commentary and teaching on the Sacred Liturgy, in his own liturgical style, and in specific official actions such as <em>Summorum Pontificum</em> and <em>Anglicanorum Coetibus</em>. This has been further promoted by specific Bishops and religious houses, who (interestingly) all have a slightly different approach to all of it: a diversity of style, thought, and opinion that is required for a movement to become a robust culture instead of a cliquey fad.

This has all been going on for quite some time. But one thing has been missing.

Commercialization.

Some people balk at such a word, at such a thought. But this is misplaced, misguided.

I do not mean simply seeking to make money, to "sell out" the movement for a quick buck. I mean finding a way to package and promote the "new music" (!) in way that achieves two goals:
<ol>
<li>Ease of use by those not familiar with the material.</li>
<li>A sustainable business model that allows promoters to make a living while focused on promotion of ideals.</li>
</ol>

I'm on the record STRONGLY in support of Open Source and Free Culture. To be clear: I am in no way of the opinion that Free/Open is in opposition to or a hindrance to commercialization.

That being said, there has, up to now, been some difficulty bridging the gap from "everything is Free!" to "here- would you like to buy this?" This is a shortcoming of us (people), not the precepts of Free Culture (in my opinion, obviously).
