## 10. Advises you not to write in the first person
It is typical of Statist English Teachers to tell you that you should write your essays (or whatever else) without any reference to the first person. While many excellent writers do avoid the first person, many others embrace it, and it is simply a matter of style and the specific purpose of your writing.

Statists, however, will advise you to never write in the first person, in an attempt to impersonalize the writing process and create an artifical separation between you and your writing. This is a first step in the Statist plan to divorce your individuality from your actions. 

Also, Statists love it because it is an arbitrary rule that makes no sense.

## 9. Admonishes you for use of the passive voice
Both the active and the passive voice are valid uses of the language, and a skilled writer knows when to employ each. But a Statist, lacking all nuance and having an appreciatino for easily testable regulations, will tell you that use of the passive voice should be avoided at all costs.

In fact, it's even worse than arbitrary and stupid. Insistence on the use of the active voice is a precursor to the Statist requirement that we all become snitches and informers, naming names and turning in our friends. Without the passive voice, we will never be able to say, "the document was leaked," but will be compelled to reveal who actually leaked it.

## 8. Wishes English had an official academy like the French and Spanish
This is usually expressed like, "The problem with the English language is that we have no official academy to determine what is and isn't proper English, like they do in French and Spanish. Without that kind of control, it's just chaos."

It should be fairly obvious that anyone who wishes that a pseudo-governmental agency exerted control over something as fundamental and natural as human language is a damned Statist. If it isn't obvious, one look at the [ridiculous costumes and pompous ass-holery of the French Academy](http://www.xn--acadmie-franaise-npb1a.fr/les-immortels/lhabit-vert-et-lepee) ought to confirm for you that this is a very bad idea.

## 7. Is never hopeful in a generalized sense.
Ever been corrected for saying "Hopefully, no one will correct this sentence?" You might be told that you should rewrite this to say "I hope that..." 

This is total nonsense, and hopefully you will be able to rise above the obnoxious dictates of your Statist English Teacher. Why is this nonsense? Because EVERYONE uses it this way, and that's how you determine if something is correct.

## 6. Uses the phrase "technically incorrect."
As in "'to boldly go where no man has gone before' contains a split infinitive and is *technically incorrect*."

Besides the fact that even pedantic grammarians are divided on the question of whether split infinitives are a bad idea, this statement reeks of Statist hubris. Linguistic usage is correct because well-respected masters of the form are willing to use it, not because some school-marmy grammar nazi has made up a rule about it. 

If it's good enough for NASA and Star Trek, it's not just good enough for me - it's good enough, period.

## 5. Believes that a word is a word because it is "in the dictionary."
A word is a word because people use it. You can make up a word, and it's still a word - otherwise you would call it "making up a thing similar to a word but which is not actually a word." [Any good lexicographer](http://www.ted.com/talks/erin_mckean_redefines_the_dictionary) will tell you that a dictionary is a catalog of known words, not a rule book promulgating allowable words. A dictionary is a piece of journalism, not legislation. Unfortunately, Statists are so in love with the idea that a small group of experts can dictate reality that they mistakenly think that a dictionary is an authoritative gatekeeper on the language.

## 4. Believes that a word means exactly and only what the dictionary says it means.
Along with thinking that a dictionary contains the set of all letter combinatinos which are officially words, Statist English Teachers think that dictionaries are the arbiters of meaning, when in reality they are only reporting on generally accepted understandings. This perverts a useful tool into a dangerous piece of propaganda, leading people to believe that meaning, and thus life itself, is fixed and unchageable.

## 3. Corrects standard spoken English.
You asked your teacher if you "can" borrow a pencil, and you get a stern lecture on the difference between "can" and "may." This means that your English teacher thinks that rules about written language should override the natural development of conversational speech. Only a Statist would be so arrogant.

## 2. Hates the third-person singular use of the word "they."
Statist English Teachers will tell you that you should never say "my friend said their English teacher is a damned statist." This sort of nonsense happens because Statist believe that a pronoun should match its antecedant in number, and they further believe that "they" can only be a plural pronoun. Like most Statist policies, this sounds perfectly logical in theory until you realize that without "they," there can be no third-person singular gender non-specific personal pronoun in English without "[they](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)," forcing every unknown third person into the strait-jacket cultural definitions of "he" or "she" or else robbing them of their humanity through the impersonal "it." (A Statist never considers the unintended consequences of their decrees.) 

## 1. Is an English teacher.
Let's face it, the whole idea that the English language is something you can teach in a classroom is total Statist lie.

Unless your English class is focused on advanced lingustics or post-modern literary theory, your English teacher is almost certainly a damned Statist.
