5. Believes that a word is a word because it is "in the dictionary."
A word is a word because people use it. You can make up a word, and it's still a word - otherwise you would call it "making up a thing similar to a word but which is not actually a word." Any good lexicographer will tell you that a dictionary is a catalog of known words, not a rule book promulgating allowable words. A dictionary is a piece of journalism, not legislation. Unfortunately, Statists are so in love with the idea that a small group of experts can dictate reality that they mistakenly think that a dictionary is an authoritative gatekeeper on the language.

4. Believes that a word means exactly and only what the dictionary says it means.
Along with thinking that a dictionary contains the set of all letter combinatinos which are officially words, Statist English Teachers think that dictionaries are the arbiters of meaning, when in reality they are only reporting on generally accepted understandings. This perverts a useful tool into a dangerous piece of propaganda, leading people to believe that meaning, and thus life itself, is fixed and unchageable.


3. Corrects standard spoken English.
You asked your teacher if you "can" borrow a pencil, and you get a stern lecture on the difference between "can" and "may." This means that your English teacher thinks that rules about written language should override the natural development of conversational speech. Only a Statist would be so arrogant.

2. Hates the third-person singular use of the word "they."
Statist English Teachers will tell you that you should never say "my friend said their English teacher is a damned statist." This sort of nonsense happens because Statist believe that a pronoun should match its antecedant in number, and they further believe that "they" can only be a plural pronoun. Like most Statist policies, this sounds perfectly logical in theory until you realize that without "they," there can be no third-person singular gender non-specific personal pronoun in English without "they," forcing every unknown third person into the strait-jacket cultural definitions of "he" or "she" or else robbing them of their humanity through the impersonal "it." (A Statist never considers the unintended consequences of their decrees.) 

1. Is an English teacher.
Let's face it, the whole idea that the English language is something you can teach in a classroom is total statist lie. Unless your English class is focused on advanced lingustics or post-modern literary theory, your English teacher is almost certainly a damned Statist.
