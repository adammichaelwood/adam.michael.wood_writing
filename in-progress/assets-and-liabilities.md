# Assets and Liabilities

Before I spent time in the financial services industry, I had no idea what the difference between an asset and a liability was. 

Discovering the difference - what these ideas mean in their formal accounting sense - has made a huge impact in the way I understand economics, politics, and the issues of liberty.

I believe a lack of understanding about how assets and liabilities work - what they are - is at the heart of most of society's fiscal and economic problems, and that a clear understanding of these two key concepts will change how you see the actions of the State.

## Simple Financial Explanations

Broadly speaking, an asset is anything which increases your wealth over time through your interaction with it. A liability is the opposite, anything which decreases your wealth over time through your interaction with it.

In the strictest financial terms, this generally refers to property (real or otherwise) which either generates reveneue and/or increases in value over time (on the one hand) or costs money to maintain or decreases in value over time.

This means that a car is almost always a liability, not an asset. Cars cost money to maintain, they cost money to use, and they almost always decrease in value the longer you own them (exceptions such as vintage collectible automobiles being precisely that- an exception).

Owning a Bitcoin mining rig (or shares in a Bitcoin mining pool) is probably an asset on the other hand. Assuming it works, it will generate some amount of income (Bitcoins). Additionally, its value may go up over time (as the value of Bitcoins increases, the value of mining equipment also increases, like shovels in a gold rush).

## Difficulties and Confusions

There are four major difficulties in discussing assets and liabilities in theoretical terms (especially with people who have a falsely-dogmatic sense of logic).

### Most things are a mixed bag

If you read much personal financial literature, you find that the sterotypical example of a liability is "a car." This is a great example, because it almost always is, and most people don't seem to realize it.

The sterotypical example of asset, which I avoided, is "a house." While this is generally true (real estate values tend to go up over time), it is not absolutely true (you might be in a down market, or have a house that is falling apart). Houses cost money to hold and maintain, which often makes them feel like a liability even when they are not.

Many assets - houses, businesses - cost money to maintain. Due to market fluctuations and inevitable uncertainty, the value of an asset may even decrease over some period of time. This sometimes confuses matters.

### Change in status over time

Very much related to the "mixed bag" issue, many things change their status from asset to liability over time. 

Your car is a liability now. If you maintain it well, your grandchildren might inherit it as an asset.

A house may start as an asset and then turn into a liability if the market crashes, or if your personal situation changes (see "Perspective" below).

And a Bitcoin mining rig that was an asset a few years ago is probably neither an asset or a liability at this point: it's likely to just be dead weight.

### Perspective

A car is an asset if you're a car dealership. It's part of inventory, and you almost certainly plan to sell it for more than you bought it for.

A job can be an asset if it pays well, or a liability if it stops you from pursuing other opportunities.

### You need liabilities

Before I knew the real definitions, I (like a lot of people) only had a vauge notion that liabilities are bad, and that assets are good.

This is very wrong, and it leads to people seeing things in all the wrong ways.

If you think of an asset as somehting good, anything you need or want, you'll think of your car as an asset. Afterall - you need a car to get to work, so it's helping you bring in income.

This sort of miscategorization happens all the time, and almost always it takes the form of thinking a liability is actually an asset.

Education is often categorized as an asset, even though student debt is a serious liability on many personal balance sheets. Companies talk about their employees as assets, when they are actually cost-centers. Society talks about "the children" as an asset, in some vague metaphorical way, but on the government's balance sheet, children are almost always liabilities.

Liabilities are not bad, nor are assets good. We shouldn't assign moral or existential value here - it's just a balance sheet.

Most of the time, you need liabilities. A company usually can't make money without employees. The employees are needed. But they cost money to maintain (keep employed) and they have no resale value (you generally can't sell people). They are serving the needs of the company, so it is worthwhile to spend the money, but that doesn't make them any less liabilities. Similarly, your local grocery store is fulfilling your need to have something to eat, and it is worth it to you to buy food from them. That doesn't make your grocery store an asset.

It does not matter whether you need the thing, or want the thing, or whether it brings you joy and happiness or peace and fulfilment. The central concept of assets and liabilities is a strictly financial one - this is vitally important to understanding how businesses and governments think and operate.
