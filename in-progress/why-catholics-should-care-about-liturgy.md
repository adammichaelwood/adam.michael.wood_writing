A music director is discussing the details of an upcoming Mass with his priest. The musician suggests using one of the official chants, as prescribed in the relevant books provided by the Church. The priest, after a minute or two of confusion, exclaims, "Is this one of those *liturgical* things?!"

This story has been generalized to save everyone involved from embarrassment, but I promise its a true story. And worse, any serious Catholic musician will tell you that this sort of exchange happens all the time. Priests who know and care about liturgy are the exception, rather than the rule. Among the laity, confusion and disinterest in liturgy is overwhelming.

It's hard to know why this is the case. However tempting it is to blame modernism or the post-concilliar reforms, the truth is that the problem pre-dates both the Novus Ordo and contemporary culture. I know a number people who remember careless priests rushing through the Latin Low Mass, and [historical accounts going back to the middle ages](http://bit.ly/FirstThousandYears) contain references to sloppy and irreverent celebrations of the Mass.

The one thing that seems to have changed in the late modern era is that irreverent practice (which can be explained by bad habits and carelessness) is now aided and abetted by an irreverent set of philosophies, a theological point of view that diminishes the importance of the liturgy and distorts its purpose.

I think a certain amount of obsession, by those who are called to it, is actually quite worthwhile. It is in the public liturgy of the Church that we come to understand the love of Christ which we are called to emulate. It is in the sacrifice of the Mass, dwelling in the sacrifice of Jesus, that we hear our calling to sacrifice ourselves. Recognizing Christ in the Eucharist, recognizing Christ in the assembled family of believers, gives us the eyes to recognize Christ in His “disturbing disguises” out in the world. We know how to clothe the naked because our God has clothed us in the garment of Baptism; we know how to feed the hungry because our God has fed us with his very body; we know how to comfort the dying because Our Lord has died in our midst; we know how to visit the imprisoned because God has visited us in the prison of our sin; we know how to care for orphans because our God has given us a spirit of adoption.
